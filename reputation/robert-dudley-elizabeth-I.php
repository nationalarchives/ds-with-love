            <blockquote>
                <p class="mb-0">"your Majesty’s most faithful
                    and obedient servant"</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Elizabeth I's affection for her childhood friend Robert
                Dudley was a constant throughout her reign, and at times
                her intimacy with a married man gave rise to gossip,
                threatening her reputation as a chaste and virtuous queen.
                Choosing to maintain this reputation and the balance of
                political power, she decided against marrying him after the
                death of his first wife, Amy Dudley (née Robsart). Initially
                furious at his second marriage, by the time of this letter
                and his death they were again close friends.</p>
                <p>This was his final letter to her, and his affection for his
                friend and ruler is clear – though somewhat coded in places.
                He’s drawn eyebrow-like dashes above the double-os in
                "pōōr" [the last word of the first line] to mimic her nickname
                for him – 'Eyes'.</p>

                    <p>I most humbly beseech your Majesty to pardon your poor
                        old servant to be thus bold in sending to know how my
                        gracious lady doth, and what ease of her late pain she finds,
                        being the chiefest thing in this world I do pray for, for her
                        to have good health and long life. For my own poor case,
                        I continue still your medicine and find that (it) amends
                        much better than with any other thing that hath been given
                        me. Thus hoping to find perfect cure at the bath, with the
                        continuance of my wonted prayer for your Majesty’s most
                        happy preservation, I humbly kiss your foot. From your old
                        lodging at Rycote, this Thursday morning, ready to take
                        on my Journey, by your Majesty’s most faithful and
                        obedient servant,</p>

            <h2>Why is this in The National Archives?</h2>
            <p>This letter, with the words "his last letter", written on the reverse, was found
                in a box by Elizabeth’s bedside upon her death. At The National Archives it is
                housed in a collection known as the State Papers, which includes letters and
                papers connected to the work of the Secretary of State, the chief advisor to
                the monarch. It is likely that when Elizabeth died this letter was gathered up
                into the State Papers collection.</p>
