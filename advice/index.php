            <h1>Advice</h1>
            <p>Lovers have always sought advice, from the solace
                of friends, the formal advice column or the
                public stage of a television chat show. Advice
                columns, helpfully allowing their readers to write
                in anonymously, are thought to have first emerged
                in the 1690s, soon after the arrival of newspapers.
                Early advice columns dealt with questions of
                science, philosophy and politics, but questions about
                relationships soon became a feature.</p>
