                <p class="mb-0">"...perhaps when you are away you will

            </blockquote>
            <p>A rare surviving love letter between two men, this was
                written when homosexual acts between men were
                criminalised. The author, Cyril, was just 22 and his
                disappointment at not seeing Morris and feeling unsure
                whether his love is returned is clear in the letter: "I was
                very very disappointed to find out that you were not
                coming…. I just lived for to-night when I was to have
                seen you darling".</p>
            <p>Very little is known about Cyril, Morris or their relationship
                other than what is contained in the letter. Cyril ends by
                writing "I only wish that I was going away with you, just
                you and I to eat sleep and make love together". The law
                and society at the time would have made this difficult,
                even if Morris had been willing.</p>

                    <p>My Darling Morris,
                        Just a note which I feel I must write or should I say type to
                        you. I was very very disappointed to find out that you were
                        not coming to the Club to-night, as ever since I phoned
                        you on Monday and made arrangements, I just lived for
                        to-night when I was to have seen you darling, as a matter
                        of fact I stayed in bed all day yesterday, didn’t even get up
                        to eat and just thought of you, and counting the hours until
                        I should see you, and then the terrible shock, of not being
                        with you after all, I had a terrible feeling that I should be
                        disappointed so that is the reason I telephoned.</p>
                    <p>I always feel so embarrassed when we meet as the terrible
                        thought of your trouble keeps ringing in my ears, and I hate
                        myself and cried for hours when I lay and thought it all,
                        especially when I love you, Morris darling, honestly I do,
                        it is two years almost since we first met, then I was crazy
                        about you, but you just seemed to disappear and I never
                        saw you for months and I tried to forget, and now since
                        seeing you, it has all started again, and I just had to let you
                        know how I felt, please do not think I am foolish Morris but
                        I Love You such a lot, so please if you do not feel this way
                        Heartache to me, promise that we shall always be the best of friends, I
                        know it is very difficult to think the same of me since what
                        happened, even altho’ I told you what the Doctor said, however I hope you will forgive and
                        forget.</p>
                    <p>Well Morris darling I must ring off now and pray that I may
                        see you on Saturday.</p>
                    <p>I only wish that I was going away with you, just you and I
                        to eat sleep and make love together, perhaps when you are
                        away you will think of me sometimes and even write me, I,
                        sincerely hope so.</p>
                    <p>Well Morris darling until we meet,</p>
                    <p>I am Yours with all my love for ever and always,</p>

            <h2>Why is this in The National Archives?</h2>
            <p>This letter was found during a police raid on the Caravan Club, a place where
                members of the same sex met in relative safety, in Soho in 1934. While men
                boldly met other men in the 1930s for love and lust, the material evidence
                was often destroyed for fear of the consequences. As the club was being
                raided, Cyril ripped up the letter and hid it under a divan. It was pieced
                together and typed up into its current format by police. 103 people were
                arrested during the raid. Cyril was committed to trial for aiding and abetting
                in keeping a disorderly house and found not guilty but the club owners were
                sentenced to hard labour for 20 and 12 months respectively.</p>
