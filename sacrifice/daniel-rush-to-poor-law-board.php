            <blockquote>
                <p class="mb-0">"so[o]ner then We Would be seperated
                    We Will Perish for Want"</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In August 1851 Daniel Rush wrote to the Poor Law Board
                complaining that the Bethnal Green Poor Law Union
                had refused him and his wife any money or help when
                they found full-time employment hard to come by. The
                local authorities had instead insisted the elderly couple
                should go to the workhouse which would have entailed
                "Sepratin me from my Wife Wich I have had 49 years".
                Daniel indignantly and accurately referred in his letter to
                the Consolidated General Order, issued on 26 July 1847,
                which stated that "nothing in this Order shall compel the
                Guardians to separate any married couple, being both
                [elderly] paupers…".</p>

            <p>This letter is one of thousands in the huge Poor Law Union correspondence
                series held at The National Archives, a unique and vast resource of letters
                written by the poor, many of which echo Daniel’s longing to stay at home
                with loved ones. These letters were bound into volumes that are now being
                conserved as part of a project recovering and researching the lost voices
                and experiences of the poor in the 1800s.</p>
