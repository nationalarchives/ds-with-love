                <p>What is a love letter? Convention suggests it is a handwritten expression of love, sent from one
                    absent lover to another. They can take many different forms including wills, other state records and
                    letters written to government. The National Archives contains an untold number of love letters.

            <h2>What is a love letter?</h2>
            <p>Convention suggests it should be handwritten, sent from one absent lover to
                another, a physical token that brings to mind the absent writer’s voice, their touch, their scent.</p>
            <p>But love letters can take different forms. Wills, other state records and letters written to government
                officials can all be read as expressions of different types of love – including love that has been
                criminalised, unconsummated or cut short.</p>
            <p>The National Archives contains an untold number of love letters scattered throughout the collection in
                these many different forms. It is impossible to know how many other letters have disappeared.</p>
            <p>These letters that have survived offer readers brief glimpses into the hidden worlds and loves of their
                writers over the last 500 years.</p>
