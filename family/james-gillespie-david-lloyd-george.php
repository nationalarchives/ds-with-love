            <blockquote>
                <p class="mb-0">"I am begging...give me and family
                    passage to Jamaica"</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Following an attack on his fish and chip shop in Barry,
                South Wales, Jamaican James Gillespie wrote to the Prime
                Minister requesting help for him and his family to leave
                Britain: "I am willing to leave the country at once with my
                wife and child (not without)". The attack took place during
                the 1919 race riots, a series of violent riots in port towns
                which saw black populations - many of whom had lived and
                worked here for many years and served Britain during the
                war - targeted.</p>
            <p>As in so many stories of 'everyday' people it has not been
                possible to trace what happened to James Gillespie and
                his family.</p>

                    <p>Honoured Sir</p>
                    <p>Pardon me for taking up a few seconds of your precious
                        time reading my humble letter. Sir I am a native of Jamaica
                        British West Indies. Been a seaman by profession, sailing
                        out of the Port of Barry Dock (from/since 1896 till 1917
                        when I stopped ... to go in Government work from the
                        29th of September 1917 to the 1st of June 1918. The work
                        was finished (Granaries) I started a little business in the
                        refreshment department (fish friers) until the last racial
                        riot 12 of June 1919 when my home was destroyed by the
                        rioters. I applied for repatriation for myself and family
                        several times, to the Home Office, Colonial Office and
                        the West Indian Committee, I filled a form in likewise a
                        letter from my creditors giving me permission to leave
                        the country. Its 4 months since I apply for aid to left the
                        country. I received a letter on the 21st inst. informing me
                        that I refused this offer unless 'certain concessions were
                        made'. The interpretation of the application is I am willing
                        to leave the country at once with my wife and child (not
                        without) without any compensation although I am ruin
                        in monetary matters to the amount of 227£. I have to
                        sacrifice what little I have left in furniture with the 26/ a
                        week out of</p>
                    <p>[OVERLEAF]</p>
                    <p>work donation to keep the 'wolf from the door'. I am
                        begging honoured sir as the leader of the British Empire to
                        give me and family passage to Jamaica. I am not asking sir
                        for any compensation, would pay my own fare if I was in
                        a position to do so but what little I have its just enough to
                        start with in Jamaica I don’t wants to take my family out
                        there to me a burden on the country. Trusting sir you will
                        take compassion on one of Britain’s son even if his colour
                        is black.</p>
